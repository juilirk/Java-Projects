# Space Challenge

 Capstone project (done independently) for <i> <a href = "https://in.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-programming-in-java--ud283" title = "Udacity's OOPS in Java"> Udacity's Object Oriented Programming in Java </a> </i> course.

Project Summary
---------------
The goal of the project was to run simulations of two types of rockets and determine the correct type to use for the mission to Mars. The mission consists of two phases, therefore there are two lists of items to be carried in the rockets. <br> The project runs simulations of loading the payload, launching and landing the rockets in both phases. It calculates the total budget required for each type of rocket (including crashes) to successfully reach Mars and displays them, allowing to choose the cheaper (and correct) type of rocket.

<ul>
<li>The specs for both rockets can be found <a href = "/specs/rocket_specs.txt"> here</a>. </li>
<li>Items to be carried in Phase-1 can be found <a href = "/specs/phase-1.txt"> here</a>. </li>
<li>Items to be carried in Phase-2 can be found <a href = "/specs/phase-2.txt"> here</a>. </li>
</ul>

Implemented via object-oriented programming with the use of classes, interfaces, abstraction, inheritance, method overriding, generics, and collections.

Deployment
---------
The project can be run by cloning/downloading the repository and opening in an IDE. Alternatively, one could navigate to the src folder and execute the following commands in the terminal/command-line:
```
javac *.java
java Main
```
<i>(If executing on terminal/command-line, enter the full file path to <b>phase-1.txt</b> & <b>phase-2.txt</b> in <b>Main.java</b>) </i>
